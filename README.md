# Conveyor-sorting-machine

This project was the main topic of my MECH 458 class (Mechatronics). We were tasked to wire an AT90USB1287 microcontroller with some simple circuitry to the black wiring interface. This allowed us to focus on the algorithm.

The system sorts 4 different types of objects into categories: black plastic, white plastic, steel, and aluminum. The metals fall off the plate on purpose to avoid loading down the stepper and adding too much intertial torque. The pause button allows the LCD (not in frame) to display data about the quantity of each object sorted. There is also a "ramp down" button, which essentially does the same thing as the pause button.

This project was finished over email because the Covid-19 pandemic closed down the labs before the project end. We did all project troubleshooting and design by emailing a circuit schematic and our latest revision of code into the lab instructor, who would test it for us. There was a lag time of as many as a few days between sending an iteration of code and getting a response back. 
This video was our final response received, with all project milestones reached. Thank you to the lab instructor, Patrick, for all his tireless efforts in seeing this project through.
